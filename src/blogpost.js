Since then we haven't had a chance to built anything on it, but the idea has always been very tempting. The location of the land is perfect: it’s a minute away from Hartsel and 30 minutes away from Buena Vista. The land is a dream.",

                    "It was an exhausting 14 hour drive from Phoenix, Arizona, but it was totally worth it. Upon arrival we set up our tent and had a few beers while listening to music through the speakers connected to the converter that we plugged into the cigarette lighter.",
                    
                    "The night was cold and a bit scary, because that’s when coyotes come out on the prowl, but as the morning came everything was back to normal.",
                    
                    "For the longest time my brother and I were thinking about alternative ways of living, and owning a land totally allows for it.",

                    "Unexamined Life is Not Worth Living. These words might seem a bit harsh but it's true. Just like an unread book is not worth keeping or uncooked popcorn is not worth eating, life requires some studying. The examples above seem clear, even ridiculously so, but if we zoom out a little bit, life often resembles that unread book we keep on the shelf (or the uncooked popcorn, for the argument's sake).",

                    "Life is big, it's not just one thing or another, it's not just one book. It's easy to get lost in 'the great library' of life. Examination of life is needed primarily to see what we are made of.", 
                    
                    "By studying ourselves we become aware of what we are capable of and make us see what is important (and what is not that important). It allows for efficiency, but more so for happiness by making our lives more colorful."
