I always thought my dream was to work in the film or game industry, making something millions of people should see and strive only for something like Hideo Kojima's social status. It seemed like an appropriate dream given my training in Visual Arts and a BA in FILM. I gravitated toward concept artist and storyboard artist positions and even thought about creating my own business. But I kind of just felt meh. I yearned to learn more, yearned to learn something different.

And that’s when it happened; the spark I was missing ignited the instant I made my first codepen.io material card. Since then, I can’t get enough. Front-end web development calls to all my passions; it incorporates creativity and problem solving and I’m allowed to break it to improve the code (in a separate Git branch, of course).

I love applying responsive design principles and watching my web pages shrink into mobile screens and still look amazing. It’s oddly satisfying. I think in a way I’m kind of like those web pages; I’m moldable, but I still keep my creative flare intact.

My specialties include quickly learning new skills and programming languages, problem-solving, responsive design principles, website optimization, and the Model View View Model (MVVM) and Model View Controller (MVC) methods of organizing code. So far I have JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, Express.JS, PHP, MaterialUI, Git/GitHub under my belt. I’m still enthusiastically grabbing onto any other programming languages, frameworks, or principles I can integrate into the coding web in my head.
