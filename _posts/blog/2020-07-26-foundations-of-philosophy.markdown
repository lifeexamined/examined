Philosophy is a process of examination of consciousness.

The goal of philosophy is the determination of truth that is not a goal in itself but serves as guidance to self-completeness.

#### Language
**Axiomatic Set**

_Axiom 1_: We are endowed with a set of categories

_Axiom 2_: We are endowed with a set of intuitions

_Axiom 3_: We are able to recognize and reproduce sensual data by the way of commonality/unity

_Axiom 4_: We are endowed with the ability to make connections between categories, sensual patterns, and the internal intuitions (ability for words to have meaning + contextual)

#### Specifications
**Intuitions**

_Self_

    There is self
    There is not-self
    There are selves that are not-self

_Sensual_

    Pointing
    Unity

Self Punkt 3 is a paradox but is required for language to work, the self is self-for-themselves, and therefore, it seems like an impossibility for communication to work… unless there is something that tells us that all of our selves share a lot in common, and this a lot in common is language.

By definition, this means that the base of language is fractal, i.e. based on self-similarity.

#### Reality and Imagination

**Axiomatic Set**

_Axiom 1_: Experience is what presents itself to the conscious self

_Axiom 2_: Reality, dreams, and imagination are conscious experiences

_Axiom 3_: Imagination are conscious experiences that we create and control at will

_Axiom 4_: Reality are experiences that are not imagination and have different ways of interaction than imagination

_Axiom 5_: Knowledge is possible because imagination and reality share the same nature in the way that they conform to the categories of consciousness. This means that we can have an imagination that conforms to nature to a greater or lesser degree.

_Axiom 6_: Reality can’t have something that doesn’t conform directly or indirectly to the fundamental categories because in that case, it would not be part of our experience in one way or another, and therefore wouldn’t be called reality.

**Value**

_Axiom 1_: All of the wants and needs are the result of our incompleteness. If we were complete, we would not want anything.

_Axiom 2_: Value is a measure that the want assigns in us. It is positive if something is perceived to act toward increasing completeness. It is negative if something is perceived against completeness. And null if it is neither toward nor against.

_Axiom 3_: Part of our consciousness that assigns value is called the heart.

_Axiom 4_: Our perception of completeness can be true or false. This means that our wants may diverge from our needs. We can desire things that make us more incomplete in reality. We can despise things that make us complete in reality.

_Axiom 5_: Actions are result of perceived positive value associate with an action

**Economy**

_Axiom 1_: Exchange is another result of incompleteness. Exchange can only happen when one party has something that the other party lacks (completely or incompletely) and vice versa.

_Axiom 2_: Exchange value is determined by how badly somebody wants something.

_Axiom 3_: Money is things that represent value. Usually, it’s the things that are always desirable. Food could have been a universal currency if it wasn’t perishable. Precious metals and stones serve that purpose instead. Money is another level of abstraction on top of that. Money is the most fundamental exchange unit.

_Axiom 4_: The economy is based on the desire for enrichment that is either desire for itself or as a means to obtain power. Therefore the capitalist economy’s main driving principle is either greed or lust for power.

**Nature of Truth**

_Axiom 1_

Absolute truth is imagination that completely corresponds to reality.

_Axiom 2_

Absolute lie is imagination that completely differs from reality.

_Axiom 3_

We lack the ability to possess the absolute truth.

_Axiom 4_

Lack of our ability to possess the absolute truth requires us to resort to beliefs and trust. E.g. we can trust/distrust our senses, our reasoning, our intuitions, others, etc.

**Nature of Science**

_Axiom 1_

Objective truth is an agreement between people on what they consider the truth to be. It doesn’t guarantee the truthfulness of the agreement. It is strange to consider the intersection of multiple subjective points as objective and therefore more representative of the truth. For example, it is not impossible to agree on something false if all parties are convinced of it to be true.

_Axiom 2_

Empirical experience doesn’t possess necessity, and because of that can’t show directly that something is impossible, as, in order to do that, you will have to demonstrate necessity, only if impossibility can be shown through the possibility of something else.

_Axiom 3_

Possibility of something can only be shown through the reference to the fundamental objective beliefs, and therefore may vary depending on the set of fundamental beliefs.

**Abstraction**

_Axiom 1_

Abstraction is an ability to find commonalities between collections.

_Axiom 2_

Subjects, collections, and commonalities conform to categories. Subject is said to be the most abstract when it results from the commonality of others and is further irreducible, and least abstract when it is not a result of commonality.
