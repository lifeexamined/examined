I"Ë<p>The decision to start exploring the computer science direction came after I took a bioinformatics class at the University. It was an unusual class in the sense that we wouldnâ€™t just learn the material from a textbook, but read and discuss research articles and talk about algorithms and approaches we learned from the home readings. The class combined grad students and undergrads from computer science and biology. It was super enjoyable, yet there was so much information from the papers to digest and also understand the general ideas behind algorithms. It was overwhelming, and I soon realized that I wanted to broaden my understanding so that I could navigate in this type of information more freely.</p>
