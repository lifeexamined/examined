I"¢<p>Unexamined Life is Not Worth Living. These words might seem a bit harsh but itâ€™s true. Just like an unread book is not worth keeping or uncooked popcorn is not worth eating, life requires some studying. The examples above seem clear, even ridiculously so, but if we zoom out a little bit, life often resembles that unread book we keep on the shelf (or the uncooked popcorn, for the argumentâ€™s sake).</p>

<p>Life is big, itâ€™s not just one thing or another, itâ€™s not just one book. Itâ€™s easy to get lost in â€˜the great libraryâ€™ of life. Examination of life is needed primarily to see what we are made of.</p>

<p>By studying ourselves we become aware of what we are capable of and make us see what is important (and what is not that important). It allows for efficiency, but more so for happiness by making our lives more colorful.</p>
