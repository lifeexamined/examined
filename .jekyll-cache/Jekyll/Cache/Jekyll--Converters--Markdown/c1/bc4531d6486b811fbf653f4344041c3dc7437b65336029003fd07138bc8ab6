I"[<p>We decided to take a vacation and visit our land in Hartsel, Colorado, a land Kirill bought back in 2017. Since then we haven't had a chance to built anything on it, but the idea has always been very tempting. The location of the land is perfect: itâ€™s a minute away from Hartsel and 30 minutes away from Buena Vista. The land is a dream.</p>
