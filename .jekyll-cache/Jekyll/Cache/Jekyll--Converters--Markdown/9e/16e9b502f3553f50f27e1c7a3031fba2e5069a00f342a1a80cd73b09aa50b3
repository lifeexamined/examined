I"<p>Philosophy is a process of examination of consciousness.</p>

<p>The goal of philosophy is the determination of truth that is not a goal in itself but serves as guidance to self-completeness.</p>

<h4 id="axiomatic-set">Axiomatic Set</h4>

<p><em>Axiom 1</em>: We are endowed with a set of categories</p>

<p><em>Axiom 2</em>: We are endowed with a set of intuitions</p>

<p><em>Axiom 3</em>: We are able to recognize and reproduce sensual data by the way of commonality/unity</p>

<p><em>Axiom 4</em>: We are endowed with the ability to make connections between categories, sensual patterns, and the internal intuitions (ability for words to have meaning + contextual)</p>

<p>Self Punkt 3 is a paradox but is required for language to work, the self is self-for-themselves, and therefore, it seems like an impossibility for communication to workâ€¦ unless there is something that tells us that all of our selves share a lot in common, and this a lot in common is language.</p>

<p>By definition, this means that the base of language is fractal, i.e. based on self-similarity.</p>

<h4 id="reality-and-imagination">Reality and Imagination</h4>

<p><strong>Axiomatic Set</strong></p>

<p><em>Axiom 1</em>: Experience is what presents itself to the conscious self</p>

<p><em>Axiom 2</em>: Reality, dreams, and imagination are conscious experiences</p>

<p><em>Axiom 3</em>: Imagination are conscious experiences that we create and control at will</p>

<p><em>Axiom 4</em>: Reality are experiences that are not imagination and have different ways of interaction than imagination</p>

<p><em>Axiom 5</em>: Knowledge is possible because imagination and reality share the same nature in the way that they conform to the categories of consciousness. This means that we can have an imagination that conforms to nature to a greater or lesser degree.</p>

<p><em>Axiom 6</em>: Reality canâ€™t have something that doesnâ€™t conform directly or indirectly to the fundamental categories because in that case, it would not be part of our experience in one way or another, and therefore wouldnâ€™t be called reality.</p>

<p><strong>Value</strong></p>

<p><em>Axiom 1</em>: All of the wants and needs are the result of our incompleteness. If we were complete, we would not want anything.</p>

<p><em>Axiom 2</em>: Value is a measure that the want assigns in us. It is positive if something is perceived to act toward increasing completeness. It is negative if something is perceived against completeness. And null if it is neither toward nor against.</p>

<p><em>Axiom 3</em>: Part of our consciousness that assigns value is called the heart.</p>

<p><em>Axiom 4</em>: Our perception of completeness can be true or false. This means that our wants may diverge from our needs. We can desire things that make us more incomplete in reality. We can despise things that make us complete in reality.</p>

<p><em>Axiom 5</em>: Actions are result of perceived positive value associate with an action</p>

<p><strong>Economy</strong></p>

<p><em>Axiom 1</em>: Exchange is another result of incompleteness. Exchange can only happen when one party has something that the other party lacks (completely or incompletely) and vice versa.</p>

<p><em>Axiom 2</em>: Exchange value is determined by how badly somebody wants something.</p>

<p><em>Axiom 3</em>: Money is things that represent value. Usually, itâ€™s the things that are always desirable. Food could have been a universal currency if it wasnâ€™t perishable. Precious metals and stones serve that purpose instead. Money is another level of abstraction on top of that. Money is the most fundamental exchange unit.</p>

<p><em>Axiom 4</em>: The economy is based on the desire for enrichment that is either desire for itself or as a means to obtain power. Therefore the capitalist economyâ€™s main driving principle is either greed or lust for power.</p>

<p><strong>Nature of Truth</strong></p>

<p><em>Axiom 1</em></p>

<p>Absolute truth is imagination that completely corresponds to reality.</p>

<p><em>Axiom 2</em></p>

<p>Absolute lie is imagination that completely differs from reality.</p>

<p><em>Axiom 3</em></p>

<p>We lack the ability to possess the absolute truth.</p>

<p><em>Axiom 4</em></p>

<p>Lack of our ability to possess the absolute truth requires us to resort to beliefs and trust. E.g. we can trust/distrust our senses, our reasoning, our intuitions, others, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Nature of Science</strong></p>

<p><em>Axiom 1</em></p>

<p>Objective truth is an agreement between people on what they consider the truth to be. It doesnâ€™t guarantee the truthfulness of the agreement. It is strange to consider the intersection of multiple subjective points as objective and therefore more representative of the truth. For example, it is not impossible to agree on something false if all parties are convinced of it to be true.</p>

<p><em>Axiom 2</em></p>

<p>Empirical experience doesnâ€™t possess necessity, and because of that canâ€™t show directly that something is impossible, as, in order to do that, you will have to demonstrate necessity, only if impossibility can be shown through the possibility of something else.</p>

<p><em>Axiom 3</em></p>

<p>Possibility of something can only be shown through the reference to the fundamental objective beliefs, and therefore may vary depending on the set of fundamental beliefs.</p>

<p><strong>Abstraction</strong></p>

<p><em>Axiom 1</em></p>

<p>Abstraction is an ability to find commonalities between collections.</p>

<p><em>Axiom 2</em></p>

<p>Subjects, collections, and commonalities conform to categories. Subject is said to be the most abstract when it results from the commonality of others and is further irreducible, and least abstract when it is not a result of commonality.</p>
