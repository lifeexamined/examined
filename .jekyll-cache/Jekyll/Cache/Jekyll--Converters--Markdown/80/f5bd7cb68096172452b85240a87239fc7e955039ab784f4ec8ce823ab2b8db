I"ä<p>I always thought my dream was to work in the film or game industry, making something millions of people should see and strive only for something like Hideo Kojimaâ€™s social status. It seemed like an appropriate dream given my training in Visual Arts and a BA in FILM. I gravitated toward concept artist and storyboard artist positions and even thought about creating my own business. But I kind of just felt meh. I yearned to learn more, yearned to learn something different.</p>
